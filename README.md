## Introduction

The EventNtuple is a simplified data format that can be used for Mu2e analyses.

## Structure
The EventNtuple structure is complex. Some branches consist of a single object (e.g. ```evtinfo```), some are vectors of objects (e.g. ```trk```) and some are vectors-of-vectors of objects (e.g. ```trksegs```).

A [list of branches is available](./doc/branches.md)

The help understand what all the branches and leaves mean, we have an [```ntuplehelper```](doc/ntuplehelper.md) tool

## How to Check the EventNtuple
You can get some basic information about the EventNtuple file useing ```checkEventNtuple``` like so:

```
checkEventNtuple file1.root file2.root
```

This will print the version number (for versions after v6.3.0) and the trigger branches in the file (for versions after v6.8.0)


## How to Analyze an EventNtuple
To help with analyzing the EventNtuple given its complex structure, we have two sets of utilities:
* [```RooUtil```](rooutil/README.md) for ROOT-based analyses, and
* [```pyutils```](https://github.com/Mu2e/pyutils/blob/main/README.md) for python-based analyses.

Feel free to send questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement to the #analysis-tools Slack channel.

## How to Create an EventNtuple
In case you need to create your own EventNtuple you can do the following from a clean login in your working directory with the list of files you want to run over in a text file called ```your-art-filelist.txt```:

```
mu2einit
muse setup [AnalysisMusing]
mu2e -c EventNtuple/fcl/from_mcs-mockdata.fcl -S your-art-filelist.txt
```
where ```[AnalysisMusing]``` is the musing relevant for your dataset. At the time of writing, this is either ```AnalysisMDC2020``` or ```AnalysisMDC2025```

This will create a file called ```nts.owner.description.version.sequencer.root``` that contains the EventNtuple. The EventNtuple will then be in the ROOT file as ```EventNtuple/ntuple```.

Note: Other fcl files are available. See table [here](fcl/README.md) to see if another one is more appropriate for your use case.

## Notes for Developers
Notes for developers contributing to EventNtuple are [here](doc/developers.md)

## Validation
For a quick validation, you can run:

```
. ./EventNtuple/validation/quick_test.sh
```
This will run Offline on a mock dataset, create the validation histograms, and then put a few of these validation histograms into a canvas.

More validation scripts and validation instructions are [here](validation/README.md)

## Tagging a New Release
Instructions for tagging a new release:

* have a working area set up with a backing to the latest SimJob and a clone of EventNtuple (you might already have this)
```
cd /your/work/area
muse backing SimJob MDCXXXXvv
muse setup
git clone git@github.com:YourGitHubUsername/EventNtuple.git
cd EventNtuple/
git remote add -f mu2e https://github.com/Mu2e/EventNtuple.git
```

* from your clone of the EventNtuple, fetch the latest version of the code from the main Mu2e repository and make a new branch:
```
git fetch --tags mu2e main
git checkout --no-track -b vXX-YY-ZZ mu2e/main
```
* update version number in histogram ```_hVersion``` in ```src/EventNtupleMaker_module.cc``` and commit
* make sure EventNtuple runs following these [steps](validation/README.md#Validating-eventntuple-runs)
  * if any test fails, then you can look in ```test_fcls.log``` to see the error. You can also see the command to rerun and debug locally without having to re-run the whole ```test_fcls.sh``` script
* also make sure ```roodask``` by following these [steps](validation/README.md#Validating-roodask-runs)
* create a "before" ntuple with the previous release of EventNtuple. In a fresh login:
```
mu2einit
muse setup [AnalysisMusing and version]
mu2e -c EventNtuple/fcl/from_mcs-mockdata.fcl -S ../EventNtupleDev_NewTag/filelists/mcs.mu2e.ensembleMDS2cMix1BBTriggered.MDC2020ba_best_v1_3.art.list --TFileName nts.ntuple.before.root -n 100
root -l -b ${MUSE_WORK_DIR}/EventNtuple/validation/create_val_file_rooutil.C\(\"nts.ntuple.before.root\",\"val.ntuple.before.root\"\)
```
  * you can get the ```AnalysisMusing``` and ```version``` from the [EventNtuple page on the wiki](https://mu2ewiki.fnal.gov/wiki/EventNtuple#Version_History_%26_Musings)
* create a comparison booklet following these [steps](validation/README.md#Validating-EventNtuple-Contents)
   * make sure any differences are understood
* open PR with final changes and merge
* as of this writing (4-22-2026), this step does not work: (make sure EventNtuple builds with spack following these [steps](validation/README.md#Validating-EventNtuple-Builds-SpackCMake), fix any errors and merge them)
   * this needs to be done after merging so that we can checkout the ```main``` branch
* create new release on GitHub
   * auto-generate release notes but add text to highlight important changes
* ask for a new Musing to be made
* post announcement on #analysis-tools Slack channel
* update [Mu2eWiki page](https://mu2ewiki.fnal.gov/wiki/EventNtuple)
* present updates at next Infra / Tools meeting
