# roodask — Dask Distributed C++ Job Runner

Compile and run a C++ ROOT macro across Dask workers.  Input files are
read from a filelist and automatically batched into jobs.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a filelist (one ROOT file per line)
ls /data/files/*.root > filelist.txt

# Edit jobs.json: set your source file, includes, and output pattern
vim jobs.json

# Compile and run locally — files distributed evenly across all CPUs
python roodask.py --manifest jobs.json --filelist filelist.txt

# 5 files per job, 4 workers
python roodask.py --manifest jobs.json --filelist filelist.txt \
    --files-per-job 5 --n-workers 4

# Only process the first 10 files (useful for testing)
python roodask.py --manifest jobs.json --filelist filelist.txt --max-files 10

# Skip recompilation on subsequent runs
python roodask.py --manifest jobs.json --filelist filelist.txt --skip-compile

# Merge all output files with hadd after completion
python roodask.py --manifest jobs.json --filelist filelist.txt \
    --hadd merged.root --hadd-j 4

# Connect to an existing Dask scheduler
python roodask.py --manifest jobs.json --filelist filelist.txt \
    --scheduler tcp://scheduler-host:8786
```

## File Overview

| File             | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `roodask.py`    | Main script — compiles, batches, submits, collects   |
| `jobs.json`      | Manifest — source file, includes, output pattern     |
| `filelist.txt`   | Input filelist (one ROOT file per line)              |

## Manifest (`jobs.json`)

**Source example** (compile a ROOT macro):
```json
{
  "source": "PlotEntranceMomentum.C",
  "include_dirs": ["${ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH}"],
  "libraries": [],
  "compile_flags": [],
  "output_dir": "./output",
  "output_pattern": "{first_filestem}_{job_id}.hist.root",
  "timeout_seconds": 3600
}
```

**Binary example** (run a pre-compiled program with custom args):
```json
{
  "binary": "RooCount",
  "args": ["{filelist}", "{output}", "MDS3a"],
  "output_dir": "./output",
  "output_pattern": "{first_filestem}_{job_id}.hist.root",
  "timeout_seconds": 3600
}
```

**Fields:**
- `source` — path to the C++ ROOT macro (relative paths resolve from cwd).
  The macro's entry-point function must match the filename stem
  (e.g. `PlotEntranceMomentum.C` → `void PlotEntranceMomentum(...)`).
  The `#include` in the generated wrapper uses this exact string, so ensure
  the macro is findable via your `include_dirs`.
- `include_dirs` — *(optional)* extra `-I` include paths for compilation.
  Colon-separated values (like `${ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH}`) are automatically
  split into individual `-I` flags.
- `libraries` — *(optional)* extra `-l` libraries to link
- `compile_flags` — *(optional)* additional compiler flags (e.g. `["-O2"]`)
- `binary` — *(alternative to `source`)* path to a pre-compiled executable;
  skips compilation entirely
- `args` — *(optional)* list of command-line arguments passed to the binary.
  Supports `{filelist}` and `{output}` placeholders which are replaced per job
  with the actual filelist and output file paths.  If omitted, the default
  invocation is `<binary> <filelist> <output>`.
- `output_dir` — directory for output files (relative paths resolve from cwd)
- `output_pattern` — output filename pattern; available placeholders:
  - `{job_id}` — auto-generated job ID (e.g. `job_0000`)
  - `{first_filestem}` — filename of the first input file in the batch,
    stripped of the `.root` extension (e.g. `nts.ntuple.mock001`)
- `timeout_seconds` — per-job timeout (default: 3600)

**Environment variables:** All string values support `${VAR}` syntax,
expanded from the current shell environment at load time.

## Filelist

A plain text file with one input file path per line:

```
/data/run001/file_001.root
/data/run001/file_002.root
/data/run002/file_003.root
```

Blank lines are ignored.  Use `--max-files N` to process only the first
N files (useful for quick testing).

## Compilation

When `source` is specified, the script:

1. **Auto-generates a `main()` wrapper** (`work/<MacroName>_main.cpp`) that
   `#include`s the macro using the exact name from the manifest (e.g.
   `#include "PlotEntranceMomentum.C"`) and calls its entry-point function
   with `argv[1]` (input filelist) and `argv[2]` (output file).  Ensure the
   macro is findable via `include_dirs`.
2. **Compiles** the wrapper with `g++` (or `$CXX` if set) and
   `root-config --cflags --libs`.

Additional compilation details:
- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` entries are added as `-L` and `-Wl,-rpath` flags so the
  correct `libstdc++` and other shared libraries are found at link time.
- `-Wl,--enable-new-dtags` converts RPATH to RUNPATH so `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  takes priority at runtime (works around GCC embedding its own lib64 as
  DT_RPATH).
- `-ltbb` is added automatically (required by ROOT's libImt but not
  included by `root-config`).
- Compilation is **incremental**: the script compares the source file's
  modification time against the binary and only recompiles when the source
  is newer.
- Use `--skip-compile` to force skipping compilation regardless of timestamps.
- Use `--force-compile` to force recompilation even if the binary is up to date.
- The binary is placed in the work directory (`./work/` by default).

## File Batching

Input files from the filelist are automatically split into jobs:

- **`--files-per-job N`** — each job gets exactly N files.
- **If omitted** — files are distributed evenly across the total number of
  worker slots (`n_workers × threads_per_worker`), so each slot gets
  roughly the same workload.

## Environment Propagation

The full environment (`PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, etc.) from the submitting
shell is captured and passed to each worker subprocess, ensuring the compiled
binary runs with the same library paths as the compilation environment.

## Merging with hadd

Use `--hadd <output.root>` to merge all successful job outputs into a single
ROOT file after all jobs complete.  If a relative path is given, the merged
file is placed in the output directory.  The individual per-job output files
are automatically deleted after a successful merge to save disk space.

Use `--hadd-j N` to control hadd parallelism (default: 1, set to 0 for all
available cores).

## Post-Merge Command

Use `--post-hadd CMD` to run a command on the merged file after a successful
hadd.  The `{merged}` placeholder is replaced with the full path to the
merged file.

```bash
python roodask.py --manifest jobs.json --filelist filelist.txt \
    --hadd merged.root --post-hadd 'my_plotter {merged} --style fancy'
```

The command runs via the shell, so pipes and other shell features are
supported.  It only executes if hadd succeeds.

## Error Detection

Jobs are marked as **failed** if:
- The binary exits with a non-zero return code, OR
- The binary's stderr contains the word `Error` (catches ROOT errors like
  `TFile::TFile: file does not exist` that don't set a non-zero exit code)

## How It Works

1. Reads the manifest and filelist
2. Optionally truncates to `--max-files` files
3. Splits input files into batches (by `--files-per-job` or evenly across workers)
4. **Compiles** the C++ macro if the source is newer than the binary
   (unless `--skip-compile`)
5. Starts a `LocalCluster` or connects to an existing scheduler
6. Captures the current shell environment for worker subprocesses
7. For each batch/job, submits a task to a Dask worker that:
   - Writes a per-job filelist (`work/<job_id>_filelist.txt`)
   - Runs `<binary> [args...] <filelist> <output_file>` (args from manifest,
     with `{filelist}` and `{output}` placeholders substituted)
   - Captures stdout, stderr, return code, and elapsed time
8. Collects results as jobs complete and prints progress
9. Writes `results.json` with all job outcomes (all paths are absolute)
10. Optionally merges outputs with `hadd` and cleans up individual files
11. Optionally runs a post-hadd command on the merged file
